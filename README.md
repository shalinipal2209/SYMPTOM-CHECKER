# PROJECT TITLE
Symptom checker
# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a simple Symptom Checker that helps users identify possible health conditions based on the symptoms they enter. The program compares user-provided symptoms with a small disease database and displays the most likely matches. It uses basic Python concepts such as dictionaries, sets, input handling, and conditional logic to provide quick, rule-based health suggestions.
# OBJECTIVES
1. To design a simple symptom-based disease prediction system using Python.

2. To take user symptoms as input and match them with a predefined disease database.

3. To identify possible diseases based on the number of matching symptoms.

4. To display potential diagnoses in order of highest match.

5. To apply basic programming concepts such as lists, sets, dictionaries, and conditional statements to a real-world healthcare problem.
   
# TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Programming Language: Python

2. Tools:

3.Any text editor (VS Code / Notepad++ / IDLE)

4.Command Prompt / Terminal

Technologies:

1.Python dictionaries

2.Set operations

3.Conditional logic

4.Basic sorting

# REQUIREMENTS
Python installed (any version 3.x)

Code editor (optional)

Hardware Requirements:

1.Basic computer/laptop

2.Minimum 2 GB RAM

3.Keyboard for input

Functional Requirements:

1.User can enter symptoms

2.System compares symptoms with predefined dataset

3.System displays possible diseases

Non-Functional Requirements:

1.Fast matching

2.Simple and readable output

3.Easy to use for any user

# ALGORITHMS
1. Start the program.

2. Take symptoms from the user (comma-separated).

3. Clean the input and convert it into a set.

4. For each disease in the database:
   Count how many symptoms match.
   Store diseases that have at least one match.

5. If matches exist:
Sort diseases by highest match count.
Display them.

6. If no matches exist, show “No matches found.”

7. End the program.
   
# HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
1. Install Python on your computer.

2. Save your code as main.py.

3. Open Command Prompt / Terminal.

4. Navigate to your folder:

5. Run the Program

6.Enter symptoms when asked

7. The program will display the possible disease.

# FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
1.Add more diseases and symptoms.

2.Use machine learning for better accuracy.

3. Add severity checking (mild/moderate/severe).

4. Add voice input or chatbot interface.

5. Convert into a mobile or web app.

6. Provide emergency warnings for dangerous symptoms.

7. Allow users to save symptom history.
